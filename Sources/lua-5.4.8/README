This is Lua 5.4.8, released on 21 May 2025.

Modifications made to support installation inside a Swift package:
 - all headers moved into ./include except for ljumptab.h
 - main function removed
 - extra wrapper functions provided in swiftsupport.c and swiftsupport.h. This is mainly to fix how Swift doesn't import varadic functions or some macros
